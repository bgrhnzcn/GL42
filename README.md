# Q&A
### Why made this library?

There is no reason outside of my learning experience. And fun. Maybe?

### What is the 42 stand for?

There is no meaning of 42. I am student of 42Istanbul and wanted to learn graphic libraries and basics of graphics programing. I selected OpenGL because a lot of tutorial and information about it and has large community. So, I was need a name for this project and I decided this name. Just it.
